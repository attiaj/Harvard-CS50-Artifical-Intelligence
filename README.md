This repo contains project code for the CS50: Artificial Intelligence with Python online course offered by Harvard University. The course is structured in 7 modules: Search, Knowledge, Uncertainty, Optimization, Learning, Neural Networks, and Language.

**Search**:

This module covers search algorithms, such as:
- Depth-First Search
- Breadth-First Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search
- Minimax
- Depth-Limited Minimax

**Project Code**:
- **maze**: Implements DFS and BFS to find the optimal path through a maze, from point A to point B
- **degrees**: Implements BFS to find the shortest path between two actors, in the method of "6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"
- **tictactoe**: Implements Minimax to create an unbeatable AI in the game TicTacToe
